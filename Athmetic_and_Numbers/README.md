# 🖥️ Bash Scripting: Arithmetic & Numbers

## 📌 Overview
This Bash script demonstrates various arithmetic operations and number manipulations. It covers basic calculations, comparisons, and other numeric operations that are useful in shell scripting. 🚀

## 📜 Features
✅ Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
✅ Modulus and exponentiation
✅ Floating-point arithmetic using `bc`
✅ Comparisons (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-gt`, `-le`, `-ge`)
✅ Increment and decrement operations

## 🚀 Usage
To execute the script, run the following command:
```bash
bash arithmetic_script.sh
```
Make sure to grant execute permission if needed:
```bash
chmod +x arithmetic_script.sh
./arithmetic_script.sh
```

## 🛠️ Example Operations
```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Modulus: 0
```

## 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Bash installed. You can check your Bash version using:
```bash
bash --version
```

## 📝 Notes
- Use `expr`, `let`, `$(( ))`, or `bc` for calculations.
- Floating-point arithmetic requires `bc` as Bash does not support decimals natively.
